Scans files for malware signatures

Some info. Scanner-vX.php - scans files for malware signatures.

## Scanner Vx

Scans folder and folders below current for "malware potential signatures" (see array)

Returns (1) folders and files scanned (on screen) as they are scanned
        (2) table of found signatures with lots info in cols (on screen)
        (3) same columns as (2) as a CSV file: scan_results.csv in same folder to download

Single file utility - upload into base folder and run e.g. domain.com/scanner-vx.php

## Notes

V5 20240113 Tidy up and debug info

V4 20240113

### Modifications:

1. **New Parameter for Modified Date:** The function `scanDirectory` now includes 
  an optional parameter `$modifiedSince`. This parameter can be passed a 
  date string (like '2021-01-01'). 
  
  If this parameter is not provided or is empty, the function will scan all files.

2. **Timestamp Comparison:** Inside the function, the provided date is converted 
  to a Unix timestamp. The script then compares the last modified time 
  of each file (also as a Unix timestamp)
  
Only files found with a last modified date => than this modified date will be shown.
  
Example parameters:

$directoryToScan = '.'; // Current directory
$fileTypes = ['txt', 'php', 'css', 'js']; // File types
$searchStrings = ['malwareSignature1', 'malwareSignature2']; // Search strings
$modifiedSince = '2024-01-12 15:30:00'; // Example full date and time

Important Notes:

Make sure that the modifiedSince string is formatted correctly and matches the format 
expected by the strtotime() function in PHP. 
Common formats like "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" should work well.

**Time Zones: Verify that there's no time zone conflict.**
Ensure that the server's time zone and the time zone assumed in your $modifiedSince 
string are aligned. If needed, use date_default_timezone_set() to set the correct 
time zone in your script.

Time Zone Awareness:

Be aware of time zones when dealing with times. The time interpreted by strtotime() 
  will be based on the time zone setting of your PHP environment.

Date and Time Format: 

Ensure that the date and time format you provide is compatible with strtotime(). 
	The format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" is widely used and recommended for clarity and compatibility.

Server Time Settings: 

The file modification times are typically based on the server's clock. 
  Make sure the server time is correctly set and synchronized.

V5 some tidying up and debugging stuff - seems to work and be effective now :)
V4 includes the ability to only scan files after and including a specified date.
V3 includes the date and time the file was last modified
V2 reads file line by line to get hold of the line number of the string found
V1 reads the whole file in one go (perhaps faster).
